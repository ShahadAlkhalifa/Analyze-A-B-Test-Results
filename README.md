# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

This is an A/B testing assignment completed for Udacity's Data Analyst NanoDegree Program. The project consisted of understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and helping the company understand through statistical conclusions, if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision

# Objectives
- practice working on A/B testing projects and their practical difficulties
- perform A/B tests and make recommendations backed by computed inferences

# Findings
There is no enough evidence that the new_page increases the conversion rate as compared to the old_page. There is no evidence that the countries influence the conversion rate.
